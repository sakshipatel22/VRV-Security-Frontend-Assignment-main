## VRV Security Frontend Assignment

This repository contains the frontend code for my project developed as part of the VRV Security assignment for the Frontend Intern position. This project is built using React.js and focuses on creating a user-friendly and responsive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) interface.

## Project Overview

The RBAC UI is designed to help administrators manage users, roles, and permissions, offering functionalities to:

- Create, edit, and delete users
- Assign roles and permissions dynamically to users
- Search and filter users 

## Features

1. ### Dashboard:
   View a comprehensive overview of users and their roles in the system.
2. ### Manage Users:
   Add, edit, and delete users while managing their status (Active/Inactive).
3. ### Manage Roles:
   Define new roles, edit existing roles, and delete roles as necessary.
4. ### Manage Permissions:
   Assign and modify permissions for roles dynamically.
5. ### Search and Filter:
   Search for users based on their name or email and filter them as needed.

## Technologies Used

- React.js for building the user interface.
- React Router for managing routing across different pages.
- Styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling.
- Context API to manage global state (e.g. theme management).
